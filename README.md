# Gridfinity_Parametric_Boxes
Touch up of VoidStar's (Zack Freedman) Gridfinity storage system, specifically the divider boxes.

Specifically the divider bins.

Bins can now be resized in any combination up to and 10x10 grid.
Lable holder can be removed by setting labelEnable to False

Magnet and screw holes can be removed by suppressing the last 3 features.

I havent gotten the dividers working parametrically, if someone wants to do that please submit a pullrequest.

There are a few STL's in here that i have exported from this template, some with heavy modifications.
